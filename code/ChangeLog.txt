2.	Switched back from modified version of Fancybox and Colorbox to original versions, since JQuery Tooltip can be used without modifying those libraries.
3.	Switched the image_resize call to wp_get_image_editor, since image_resize is deprecated in WP 3.5

2.	Completely separated out conditional WPML code so that it doesn't load with the theme.
3.	Moved CSS generation code to dedicated CSS generation file from functions.php. This reduces the load for those scenarios where CSS doesn't need to be generated.
4.	Added option to disable widgets. This way unused widgets don't contribute to code.

10. Left and Right arrow icons were reversed in one iconset

	been rectified to mimic the behaviour of the native "Recent Posts" widget.
12.	Got rid of 404 errors for FancyBox on IE6 - theme doesn't aim for IE6 support, so FancyBox support for it was not needed either.

Version 4.3.3 - 26th Sep 2012
=============================

=============================
1.  Removed deprecated API calls for WP 3.4 (add_contextual_help, suffusion_version_checker which used get_theme_data).
2.  Added support for native Custom Headers. This only works for WP 3.4 and upwards, because Suffusion supports flexible width headers, which are not available with older versions.

	b.  "Aquaticus Social" by Jwloh Lin: Replaced by Elegant Themes' social media icons (GPL) and icons from the "Faenze Icon Theme" (GPL).

15.	Fixed an issue with the "Author above comment" type of display for comments in Chrome.
16.	If the drop-down menu was very long, it automatically introduced a scrollbar and some empty space at the bottom. The
	behaviour has been modified for Firefox and IE, where the scrollbar only shows upon hovering over the menu. Chrome still has the issue.

Version 3.9.2 - 19th Oct 2011
=============================
1. 	Made the loading of the Google Fonts' CSS conditional. Otherwise a link without parameters was being generated, causing a useless server round-trip.
2. 	Added an option to disable the audio shortcode. This lets you avoid conflicts with other plugins that define the short code, and it also
	prevents the loading of the JS file unnecessarily. See Other Graphical Elements -> Post Formats for details.
3. 	Fixed an issue with floating the wide sidebar - if not floated, this was conflicting with certain plugins.
4. 	Added more Google fonts.
5. 	Switched drop-caps off by default.
6.	Added options to disable advanced gallery template and not randomize the thumbnails.
7.	Added explicit licensing information to readme.txt for the icon sets and the Audio Player.

Version 3.9.1 - 15th Oct 2011

2. Introduced a new style of comment forms, where the labels are inside the input fields. See Back-end -> Comment Settings -> Comment form labels styles
3. Introduced a couple of new styles of comment display, where the comment is displayed as a speech bubble with the author information above or below it.
   See Back-end -> Comment Settings -> Comment Styles.
4. Introduced the capability to position the drop-down menu in "Navigation Bar Below Header" at the left, center or right.
5. Introduced a new capability to position the drop-down lists in "Navigation Bar Above Header" at the center.

11. Added drop-caps support by content display type and by post format type.
12. Added special styling for the Status post format.
13. Added special support for the Audio post format.
	a. 	Added a new short-code "audio" that is defined only if the JetPack audio short-code is not there and the Audio Player plugin is not installed.
	b. 	If a post with "audio" post format has an [audio] shortcode, or has an audio-file as an attachment or has a URL linking to an audio file, that file is
		shown in an audio player.
	c.	No support for the HTML5 <audio> tag because Suffusion doesn't do HTML5.
14. Added special styling for the Gallery post format.
15. Improved EXIF display by making it toggled.
16. Added new hook for skin-specific setup, suffusion_skin_setup_{$skin_name}
17. Fixed a bug where the navigation bar was floating to the left in certain conditions.
18. Added new icon sets, based on StudioPress' GPL icons. See Skinning -> Icon Sets.
19. Added minor features to Featured Content to let images be centered and/or occupy the full-width of the slider.
20. Added pseudo-capability to disable comments for images and other attachments. Comments will still be enabled through the back-end,
	however users can choose to hide the comment form on the front-end if they wish.
21.	Bundled 2 post format icon sets with the theme. These can be used with the post format icon placeholders, which are sprite-enabled. Native integration will
	be provided in the next release.
22. Minor modifications: "Theme Skinning" is called "Skinning", "Sidebar Configuration" is called "Sidebars" and "Back-end Settings" is called "Back-end"
23. Fixed a bug that was preventing the skinning of the date box.
24. Made improvements to the mosaic layout. Added Fancybox and Colorbox support

7. Added the skin name as a class for the return of body_class. Also made suffusion_get_pseudo_template_class return array instead of string.

Version 3.8.3 - 14th Sep 2011
=============================

2. Ensured that wp_head() is the last call before </head> (Trac ticket #4622).

7. Fixed table styling in main content and comments (Trac ticket #4622).
8. DID NOT Introduce support for native WP header customization (Trac ticket #4622). The functionality being implemented in the theme is "Custom Header BACKGROUND",
   not "Custom Image Header". See https://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/theme-reviewers/2011-September/006871.html and the ensuing thread,
   particularly https://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/theme-reviewers/2011-September/006876.html, where I was asked to build something custom.
9. Introduced support for native WP background customization (Trac ticket #4622). If there is a custom background the theme background settings are ignored. The theme options have been retained for backwards compatibility.
10. Minor bug fix to allow displaying of the "Links" title in the "Static Tabbed Sidebar"

27. Moved out functions designed for potential BP child themes to a separate file, bp-integration.php
28. Split out BuddyPress styles to another sheet called bp.css. This isn't a BP theme by default, so BP styles will only be loaded if BP is active.
	Also added "function_exists" checks to all the functions to ensure backwards compatibility.
29. Deleted unused method suffusion_comment_pagination.
30. Changed code for printing the title to use wp_title() instead of get_bloginfo(). This is to ensure full compatibility with SEO plugins.

32. Use one instance of meta-box callback in Edit Post/Edit Page instead of 2.
33. Changed default formatting of text to be left/right instead of "justify".
34. Pushed the file inclusion in suffusion-widgets.php to happen upon the "widgets_init" action. This will ensure that the files are included only on screens that need it.
	This speeds up a lot of the loading process.
35. Added option to disable the aspect ratio preservation of images, under Other Graphical Elements -> Miscellaneous.
36. Did major stylesheet cleanup to remove redundant styles. Also optimized the menu CSS
37. Removed the FAQ section from the options panel (it was dated).

4. Added a new "Query Users Widget" to display site users and/or a user profile.
5. Added a new "Child Pages Widget" to display child pages for a current page. The title of the widget supports short-codes, so you

6. Added support for manual excerpts in pages.
7. Changed code to not store "default" for a post template while saving.
8. Renamed the "Category Posts" widget to "Query Posts". Added capabilities to display recent posts, random posts

11. Removed the use of "jquery-dialog" from the admin panel. The screen-specific help texts have been added via the add_contextual_help function.
	Some admin panel text markup was changed to make it look better in the contextual help screen. This should make the back-end slightly faster.
12. There was a problem with the "No Sidebars" template in IE7, where if there was no widget area below header/above footer, and if
	comments were disabled, the content boxes shrunk to the width of the title.
13. Added a fix for an IE8 bug that doesn't show post thumbnails when floated.
14. Updated translation file.

3. Replaced the JQuery Cycle scripts with the older version - the new one wasn't working in some cases.
4. Replaced output buffering where possible (the_tags, the_category, suffusion_print_author_byline). A couple of uses still remain,
   but those are for cases where there is no "non-echoing" getter.
5. Added classes to the post_class response to show the category id (category-xx-id), sequence number of the post (post-seq-1, post-seq-2 etc)
   and post parity (post-parity-odd, post-parity-even).
6. Fixed a bug that was causing the Featured Post Widget in a flattened "Widget Area Below Header" and "Widget Area Above Footer" to get squished.
7. Fixed a bug that would cause incorrect widths and a JS error in IE6.

5. Fixed a problem with widget styles in the bottom sidebars. They were taking the styles of the top sidebars earlier.
6. Made a couple of corrections to use get_the_title() instead of $post->post_title, to ensure that filters are applied correctly.

3. Colors were not getting correctly assigned to elements. Now fixed.
4. Reverted to JSColor from Farbtastic for miscellaneous color-related issues.

8. Not using cookies any more to store last selected JQuery tab, because of some instances where the cookies don't work.
9. Fixed a bug where the Widget Area Above Footer was not being assigned margins correctly.

7. Made function names consistent (ensured that all functions and classes began with the name "suffusion" or "suf")
